                <p>Brendan Eich is the creator of the JavaScript programming language, as well as the co-founder of the Mozilla Corporation. He was born on 4th July 1961 in Pennsylvania, USA and went on to get a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at Santa Clara University, and later earned his Master’s degree at the University of Illinois. After working on operating system and network code at Silicon Graphics for seven years, he joined Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995.</p>
                <p>At the time, Netscape had released their new internet browser, Netscape Navigator, into beta and it had been instantly successful due to being the most advanced option available at the time. The company wanted to implement a language with similar syntax to Java, which had been released the previous year, into their browser, which excluded options like Python and Perl.</p>
                <p>Eich was tasked with creating a new language for the 2.0 release of the browser and, incredibly, was able to finish the first version of Mocha in just 10 days, in time for the release in September. On release, the language was renamed to LiveScript, and then to JavaScript in December of the same year. This name was chosen to sell the language as the scripting equivalent to the compiled language, Java.</p>
                <p>As the language was developed under such strict time conditions, some questionable choices were made for certain features and interactions. One of the more well-known decisions was the flexibility with which JavaScript compares certain data types. For example, the integer 2 and the string “2” would return true if compared, something that Eich regretted adding as made it necessary to add an additional equality operator. This is why JavaScript has both == and === for equality operations.</p>
                <p>In 1998, Eich co-founded the Mozilla project, and later the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla Corporation. The company continues to manage and develop their free and open-source projects, the most famous of which are the Firefox web browser and Thunderbird email client. They also manage the MDN Web Docs, some of the most comprehensive documentation for web development languages, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>After resigning as CEO of Mozilla, Eich started a new internet security company called Brave Software. They released the internet browser, Brave, in January 2016 which places emphasis on the privacy of the user by not displaying ads or using tracking software.</p>
                <p>Brendan Eich has had a huge impact on the history of computing by creating a revolutionary new language, still in use today as one of the primary web development technologies. He was also integral to the creation of two of the most popular web browsers of their times, Netscape and Firefox. Without his impact, the way the internet works would be radically different to how it does now.</p>
