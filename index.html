                <p>For our topic, we have chosen the inventors of popular programming languages, deciding on Brendan Eich, Gudio Van Rossum, James Gosling and Dennis Richie. We picked this for our theme as programming languages have had and still do have a huge impact on the computing industry and, by extension, so have the people responsible for designing and developing these languages.</p>
                <p>In the 21st century, almost every electronic device uses a programming language in some way, including mobile phones, computers, and cars. Without the use of programming languages, the way many devices and applications we use daily would be very different and many peopleâ€™s lifestyles would likely be more difficult or at the very least, much less automated.</p>
                <p>The languages we have chosen to focus on are JavaScript, Python, Java and C, developed between 1972 and 1995 yet still amongst the most widely used. Just an example of their effect on the history of computing can be seen with JavaScript, which is the primary web development programming language in use today, or Java, which is still reportedly used by around 9 million developers primarily for client-server web applications.</p>
